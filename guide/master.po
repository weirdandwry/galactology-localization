# Welcome to The Spatials: Galactology!

In this guide you will find out how to start your first station, and then some chapters with more in depth information on the various game systems.

If your game has just been started you can also follow the tutorial windows in each game screen. They replicate many of the first steps described here. If you ignored them and are confused it would be a good idea to start a new game from scratch and follow all the tutorials before you start a station for good.
