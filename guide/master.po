msgstr "Welcome to The Spatials: Galactology!\n\n"
"In this guide you will find out how to start your first station, and then some chapters with more in depth information on the various game systems.\n\n"
"If your game has just been started you can also follow the tutorial windows in each game screen. They replicate many of the first steps described here. If you ignored them and are confused it would be a good idea to start a new game from scratch and follow all the tutorials before you start a station for good."

msgstr "Basics and building"

msgid "guide_first_station_basics"
msgstr "The very first steps of any new station are building your initial rooms. Many of the objects your staff will use in their daily life and work need a proper shelter, so it is important to first learn what makes a room in Galactology.\n\n"
"A room is well defined when its entire ground is covered in floor tiles, and its entire perimeter is composed of wall segments and/or doors.\n\n"
"You make use of two tools for building rooms: the Floor Tool and the Walls Tool.\n\n"
"The Floor Tool allows you to draw a floorplan either tile by tile or by dragging the mouse left button to draw a rectangle of tiles. Select the floor and room style you want from the listing, and if desired, a highlight color in the top bar. When drawing on the map you can also press Shift to toggle the eraser mode, or Alt plus clicking on an existing floor tile to copy its style and color. You can mix and match all kinds of floor tiles.\n\n"
"The Wall Tool allows you to draw a wall blueprint either tile by tile or by dragging the mouse left button to draw an axis aligned line of tiles. Select the wall kind. Shift for eraser, and Alt for copying also works with the Wall Tool. And you can also mix any kind of wall.\n\n"
"Both tools produce a blueprint. This blueprint serves a workplace indicator for your officers and it is not functional as a part of a room.\n\n"
"The build mode visualization is active while a build tool is selected. In this mode a grid is displayed over the map, and the game will also overlay a green color over areas detected to be a properly formed room. A noise and aesthetical value will be assigned to each room depending on its contents and floor tile choices.\n\n"
"An empty but well formed room is only the start. Next you will need to build some objects and that is the job of the Object Tool.\n\n"
"The Object Tool allows you to place an object blueprint. Select an object category, then select an object from the list. Shift and Alt perform the same functions as in the other building tools.\n\n"
"Placing a blueprint will create a construction job most of the time, even if some conditions are not meet for a valid construction. Clicking on the blueprint will reveal any errors and why a construction job is stopped, if that is the case."

msgid "guide_first_station_rations_title"
msgstr "Setting up rations"

msgid "guide_first_station_rations"
msgstr "Let's take a look at how to produce rations, as an example on how production works.\n\n"
"One of the main tasks for your station is manufacturing products. You extract resources from planets and process them in your station into products. Those products can then be consumed by your officers, sold to visitors, or sold to planets.\n\n"
"Basic Rations is the first food product you can make. It will satisfy the Hunger vital for your officers. Producing Basic Rations requires Fruits, of which you have a starter stack when creating a new game.\n\n"
"To produce one or more Basic Rations you will need to build a Basic Kitchen. Once it is built, click it with the Info Tool. In the options panel you will be able to add a new production order by selecting which recipe you want to produce and which amount.\n\n"
"A factory object like the Basic Kitchen will create tasks for your officers when it detects all the required ingredients for its current production order are in stock somewhere in the station. Then, if one of your officers has the right job enabled (and by default all redshirts have all jobs enabled), they will first load the factory object with the required ingredients and then start producing the work order, one product unit at a time.\n\n"
"It is possible to automate the creation of production orders. First set one or more factory objects to global mode with the Info Tool. Then, in the Inventory Window, select the product you want to automate, and input a desired minimal stock amount. The game will try to keep that stock amount by issuing production orders to the factories set to global production.\n\n"
"It is not enough to produce rations, you also need to provide a place for your officers to consume them. Build one or more Canteen Tables so your officers can sit down to enjoy a meal and a drink. It is also a good idea to build food dispensers nearby, like the Canteen food and drink objects."

msgid "guide_first_station_landing_title"
msgstr "Exploration and extraction"

msgid "guide_first_station_landing"
msgstr "The station needs a steady supply of resources to keep production going. No resources grow in your home planet, so you have to look for them in other planets. Fortunately there is an entire galaxy around you, with many star systems and planets to explore.\n\n"
"The galaxy screen has two zoom levels. The default zoom level shows an overview of the entire galaxy, with your home system always in the center of the screen. You can zoom into discovered star systems by clicking on their star.\n\n"
"In the system view you can see its planets orbiting the star. If any of your ships is in this system they will be parked next to a planet. Other ships will be displayed in a circle around the system, so you can always interact with your fleet from any system.\n\n"
"To issue manual travel orders to a ship, drag and drop its icon on top of a planet. This will issue a travel order and the ship will leave your station or its current parked planet and travel to its new destination.\n\n"
"Once a ship is parked over a planet it becomes possible to explore it. Click on a planet to open its info window, then click the Explore button.\n\n"
"When exploring a planet your ship crew descends on to its surface and is able to move around, fight and build objects. This is important because in order to be able to extract resources, you need to build a resource extractor next to resource nodes. Resource nodes are areas on the surface of the planet with a distinguishing aspect. Click on them to discover which resource they store, then build a extractor next to them, making sure you cover the entire area. Building more extractors over a given area will not make extraction go any faster.\n\n"
"It is also a good idea to build Storage objects on planets to increase the storage capacity. Your ships may take a long time to visit back, so it is easy to exceed the small storage capacity of an extractor object."

msgstr "Autopilot"

msgid "guide_first_station_autopilot"
msgstr "Delivering extracted resources with manual travel orders would be very tedious. You can make use of the ship autopilot feature to automate the delivery of extracted resources to your station.\n\n"
"To open the autopilot orders window, go to the galaxy screen and click on a ship icon. This window displays a listing of autopilot orders. Each order is a stop the ship will make when you enable the autopilot, using the Start Autopilot button.\n\n"
"To add orders to the autopilot click the first button in the window toolbar, Add Order. This will display a listing of all the planets you have explored and built an extractor. Select a planet to add a new autopilot order. You can add as many orders as you want to any ship, but keep in mind its cargo hold capacity and its speed. Too many orders will make for a long, slow route which can be inefficient with early model ships.\n\n"
"Autopiloted ships automatically head back home when their cargo hold is full, or when its crew average morale falls below 25%. Once it has unloaded its cargo and its crew has rested it will resume its travels from the same point.\n\n"
"Ship crews take their needs very seriously when they are resting in the station, and will often prioritize sleeping or eating before any kind of work task. Keep it in mind!"

msgid "guide_first_station_credits"
msgstr "Your initial cash will run out sooner or later. While it is not an urgent need at the very start, making money should be one of your priorities in the early game. Many actions have a price to be paid in credits, the currency of the galaxy.\n\n"
"The most straightforward way of making money is to sell products you make in your station to other planets. This is accomplished in the Sell tab of in the Civs screen. Different civs like different products. Select a product you are stocking in your station, then a planet that has a demand for it. If you have available stock and a free ship you can send a delivery right away and get paid once the ship arrives.\n\n"
"Goals always have a cash reward, and they hit on many different areas of the game. Completing goals will both net you some income and guide your station development.\n\n"
"A hands on approach to riches is plain old plundering. When you visit an hostile planet and defeat enemies they will sometimes drop items. These items can be resources, equipment or some cash.\n\n"
"Once you are confident in your production and station facilities it could be a good idea to build some visitor docks so tourists can land in your station. They will come flush with cash. The more their civ likes you, the larger their wallets."

msgstr "Your officer staff is your most valuable asset. They will build, fight and work under your orders. But you must also provide for them by making sure their needs and demands are met. Expect a mutiny if you don't!\n\n"
"You can recruit new officers in the Staff screen, selecting Recruit in the left column. Every officer you recruit has a contract price, and it goes up the bigger your staff is. There is no limit to the amount of officers you can have, only the capacity of your station and production to keep them happy and busy."


msgid "guide_officers_vitals_title"
msgstr "Vitals and mind"

msgid "guide_officers_vitals"
msgstr "Officers (and other entities like visitors) have vital needs. They are represented as bars with a value going from 0 to 100. Vitals model basic needs like hunger, thirst or hygiene. The station facilities and production must make it possible for officers to keep their vitals at a high value. For example to make sure your officer's hunger does not get too low, provide them with food and with tables to sit down to enjoy their meal.\n\n"
"Officers can also have a mind of their own. The Mind vital is calculated from the effect of Feelings on your officers. A wide variety of conditions can add Feelings to officers. For example, enjoying a meal and hitting a high value of Hunger will create a positive feeling. Not getting paid a salary will create a negative feeling that gets worse with time.\n\n"
"Mind is the most important vital, and it is calculated as the total sum of the feelings. Then, instead of being applied immediately, its value is slowly averaged over time, so a crisis has no immediate effects."


msgid "guide_officers_specs_title"
msgstr "Specs and demands"

msgid "guide_officers_specs"
msgstr "Your officers join your station because they want to live an exciting career as space adventurers, and expect to be promoted in their jobs as they get better. Performing a job will give more experience points (XP) to an officer in that job. At some point those XP will be enough to promote the officer into a new specialization (spec).\n\n"
"Specs are very important because more specialized officers also get extra perks. They are able to equip more items, and can get even more XP in some jobs. Getting more XP also means they work faster and for some professions they will also be able to manufacture more challenging products.\n\n"
"Specs are divided in 3 categories: redshirts, graduates and masters. Redshirts are the base spec for all officers. They are able to perform all the jobs in the station and excel at none of them. Gaining enough experience in any job will make it possible for a redshirt to be promoted into a graduate. Graduates are the first level of specialization. A graduate becomes incapable of performing some jobs, but at the same time they gain new item slots, higher XP caps, higher base hitpoints and power, higher productivity with difficult recipes, and the all important color uniform for their spec. Graduates in turn can gain enough XP to become a master. Masters are the ultimate professionals of your station. They will be several times faster than a redshirt at their jobs and have the highest multipliers.\n\n"
"All officers have demands. Redshirts will demand a base salary and nothing else. They will be happy to pick a random bed every time they are sleepy in any room. Graduates will demand a higher salary plus a private bed, but they will be OK with sleeping in a barrack, as long as it is a nice one. Master officers will demand a private room with a luxury bed, several special decorations, and a high aesthetical value."

The complete list of jobs can be accessed in the Staff screen on a per officer basis, which also displays the current XP progression for the job. There it is also possible to enable or disable a job for an officer. Check the Job matrix section for more information.\n\n"
"Jobs are usually offered by station objects. When a job is not active or has some missing requirements an orange warning icon is displayed over the object. Click the object for more information. Jobs often require access to one or more resources. If those resources are not available the job will not start and no officer will try to perform it. Your officers will be tasked with fetching the required resources before they start working on a job. You can speed this up by building pallets around your factory objects to directly provide them.\n\n"
"Idle officers will try to find jobs to do, but vital needs always come before work. This is specially relevant for space ship crews on a break, which will focus much more on having their vitals at a high level compared to station dwellers."

msgid "guide_officers_items"
msgstr "Equipping armor and weapons is the main way you can make your officers more powerful and resilient in combat. Wearable items are unique items that you can find in planet exploration loot, from dead enemies, and you can produce in your item factories.\n\n"
"They can be equipped in different slots like the chest or the feet. When your officers progress into a higher spec new slots become available to equip new items. Items are one time use only. Once equipped they cannot be dropped, only overwritten by another item.\n\n"
"Items can enhance two properties of your officers. Hit points determine how much damage they can take from attacks. Power boosts their active item in whatever action they take. The total sum of these values is taken from all the equipped items for a given officer. Items also have a level number and optionally can also have a rarity qualifier. The level number of an item is a good indicator of its power against same level enemies, so keep it in mind when exploring a planet.\n\n"
"Active items are used by your officers in combat. They have four possible actions: damage, healing, control and shielding. Damage items are used for attacking enemies. Healing items heal hitpoints on friendly units. Control items can stop enemies from attacking in various ways. Shielding items create a temporary shield around friendly units that absorbs damage from enemies. Officer AI is capable of controlling and using any kind of item by itself, but so are enemies."

Doing so will display an information panel in the right side of the screen. The contents of this panel will vary depending on the kind of entity you are selecting. For example officers will display a brief overview of the information displayed in the Staff screen. This panel is also divided in tabs, and many entities will have more than one. For example many objects will have a description tab with the same information displayed in the Build Tool. A fixed header area is present in most entities and displays the name and basic information like hit points or the civilization of origin of the entity.\n\n"
"It is possible to select more than one officer. Click an officer, then shift click on another officer to add it to the selection. It is also possible to drag the mouse while pressing the left mouse button to select more than one officer. Group selections do not display the info panels. Instead a compact listing of all the selected officers is displayed, along with their HP and weapon cooldown, grouped by combat role. This feature is meant to be used in combat situations.\n\n"

Rooms are enclosed spaces that must be delimited only by walls and/or doors, and their ground must be entirely covered in floor tiles. Both walls and tiles can be of any kind.\n\n"
"The Floor Tool allows you to draw floor tiles on the map. First select the floor kind you are interested in, then click once on the map to draw a tile blueprint. You can also drag with the left mouse button to draw a tile rectangle quickly.\n\n"

To change the facing angle of an object first use Q or E to change its orientation, then draw it with the left mouse button.\n\n"
"All building tools create a blueprint. Blueprints are not a real construction. They are a placeholder that creates a task that must be completed by your officers or robots with the Building job enabled.\n\n"
"You can toggle eraser mode by pressing Shift while using a building tool. The eraser mode of each tool will only erase objects of the same kind. Scenery props like vegetation and rocks can be erased with any building tool. Blueprints will be erased immediately, and built objects will be marked for erasing and will create a Building job for that.\n\n"
"Pressing Alt while using a building tool toggles copy mode. Copy mode allows you to click once on an existing object of the same kind of the selected tool to select it from the tool menu. A few complex objects like shops or pallets will also copy their settings.\n\n"

Once the station stocks for the selected resource reach that amount, your space ships on autopilot will ignore that resource. This allows you to not become overwhelmed by too much extraction of a single resource without having to change ship routes.\n\n"
"The other important value is for products. It is possible to set a global desired stock value for manufactured products.

If no visitor docks are built then you will get no visiting tourists in your station, but that will not stop hostile visitors.\n\n"
"Officer docks are for your own fleet of ships. They are not assigned automatically. After you build one you must select it and pick a ship from your fleet to assign it to it.

"Storage areas are defined by building a storage area controller inside and empty room. From that point forward the entire room floor will act as a storage area. The controller will issue delivery orders to resource stacks laying on the ground (it will not deliver from other areas, pallets or shops). You can also select which resources you want to store inside the area by selecting it with the info tool.\n\n"
"Pallets are like a 1x1 storage area that can only store a single kind of resource. In turn they allow to set precise limits to trigger restocking. When located next to factories they enable them to automatically get the required resources for production, if the pallet is stocking them, or to directly deposit the manufactured products, if the pallet is configured to accept them.

So if you open your station to tourism, make sure to only offer your products via shop objects, and to protect with door filters your storage and production areas.\n\n"
"Consumption objects like restaurant tables are mandatory for most vital tasks. For example, in order to consume a ration, an officer will require a tavern or restaurant table. Some vitals can be satisfied just by using a consumption object, like the fun vital with the use of a pinball machine, or beds for the sleep vital.\n\n"

Reading, eating and drinking (not inebriation) are a bit more tolerant but they still need a quiet room.\n\n"
"The aesthetical value of a room is calculated by averaging all the aesthetical values of its floor tiles, averaging all the aesthetical values of the objects contained inside, and then averaging those two.

You will need to win them over with tributes, embassies and trade.\n\n"
"The Sell tab allows you to sell products to civs. Not just any products. Civs have markedly different tastes and will accept only a subset of them. Also not all planets want any civ product, so opening new star systems can offer new opportunities. Planet demand oscillates in time. It may be prudent to wait awhile to get a better deal. But a slow ship can take too long to deliver the products and the price may plummet again.\n\n"
"The Resources tab shows the prices for resources extracted from the civ planets. The more a civ likes you, the cheaper those prices will become.\n\n"

"Ship speed indicates how fast a ship is when traveling between systems. The faster the ship, the less time your officers spend with decreasing vitals inside that metal box.\n\n"
"Cargo capacity indicates how many units of cargo can be carried inside the ship. Ships with very big cargo capacity are usually slow.\n\n"
"Ship skills are usually special combat skills to be used while exploring planets. They have a long cooldown and are very powerful. All ships have at least one skill, but some of them have several, and may be lacking in other areas."

While the bridge is not interactive, the bridge panels offer some extra information and allow to adjust some vital parameters of the ship\n\n"
"In the left panel you can see the current cargo hold, and select the crew of your ship. When the ship is parked at home the crew slots become buttons that can be clicked to select new officers to be part of the ship crew. Only one officer is required to pilot the ship. If you plan on using a ship to explore a planet make sure you bring more, ideally filling all six slots.\n\n"

msgid "guide_combat"
msgstr "Combat in Galactology is a mostly automated affair, with some variable level of player input. Your officers will be aware of their role depending on which kind of active item they are equipped with. Healers will seek friendly units to heal, shielders will await for damage to start affecting their friends, damage dealers will seek and pursue enemies, etc.\n\n"
"The main player input is meant to be general position orders. Select a group of officers with the Info Tool and then dragging the left mouse button. Or use the Info Tool plus shift click to add them to the selection one by one. Once you have an officer or a group selected you can issue movement orders by right clicking anywhere in the map. A Teleport action is also available to quickly transport your crew in and out of danger, with a cooldown.\n\n"
"You can save the current officer selection by pressing Ctrl then a numeric key from 1 to 6. After you do so, pressing 1 to 6 will automatically select the saved group. When you land on a planet a group is always created and bound to 1.\n\n"
"You also have the capability of issuing manual target orders. There is a target action for every kind of active item in the game (damage, healing, shielding and control). You can issue blanket orders in any heterogeneous group and they will be issued only the the appropriate officers. Use these orders when you want more tactical control over combat. For example to focus attacks on enemy healers. Manual target orders are also required when you desire to attack neutral units. By default neither the officer AI nor the normal manual target action will work with neutral units; you must issue a manual target action while pressing shift for neutral units to be targeted.\n\n"
"Additionally, for planet exploration, one or more ship skills may be available. Ship skills are powerful but have a long cooldown. They can require your direct input to select a target area."

msgstr "Most planets have one or more raw resource nodes on their surface. These nodes have a distinct look and resemble their resource in some way. They are usually clustered in groups of 1 to 5 nodes, with several groups on the surface.\n\n"
"Your factories back in your home colony will need raw resources to make products. Extracting them from planets is the only reliable way. When you are exploring a planet you have access to the Object Tool. This tool offers a selection of objects that can be built on planet surfaces.\n\n"
"The Generic Extractor, when built close to a group of nodes, will slowly extract resources from them, continuously, even if you are not exploring the planet. Only one extractor is needed per resource group, building more will not make production go faster. But you can cover as many groups as you want on the same planet.\n\n"
"These extractors also have a small storage capacity. Any excess extraction will be lost. In order save more of the production of the planet until you are ready to pick it up you can build Storage objects. These objects have a much bigger capacity and you can build many of them to their capacities together.\n\n"
"In order to deliver the production to your home colony you need to send ships to the planet, and then send them back to home. This is best done with the autopilot feature (see the Ships section for more information).\n\n"
"Extracting resources is not free. When your ship leaves with cargo from a planet you will pay a price per unit of resource. These prices depend on the resource kind and how much the planet civilization likes you. You can see these prices in the Civ screen, and they are the same for all planets of the same civ."

After you invade a planet their inhabitants will not destroy your extractors after you leave. But expect a vengeance from them on your own station.\n\n"
"Sometimes you will start a war with a civ, or meet civs that are only interested in plundering. These civs will at some point invade your allies planets, specially if you have extraction operations on them. Planets invaded by NPC civs will stop extraction and their start systems will stop sending tourists to your station. If you land on these planets you can liberate them. Check the counter Bernice is keeping, and destroy the warring civ buildings to get to 100% and liberate the planet."

The research screen allows you explore all the knowledge available, and decide which technology to research next. Research is divided in thematic groups, and each group into tiers. When you start research into a group you will aim to unlock the next locked tier inside that group, for the amount of research points it requires. Only a single group can be research at a time.\n\n"
"Research points are gained by building one more research desks on your station. Officers with the research job will automatically go there to work, as long as a research group has been selected in the research screen. You can make this process faster by disabling other jobs for some officers, so they are full time researchers. Experienced Scientists and master Researchers gain research points much faster than redshirts."
