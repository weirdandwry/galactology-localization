Welcome to The Spatials: Galactology!

In this guide you will find out how to start your first station, and then some chapters with more in depth information on the various game systems.

If your game has just been started you can also follow the tutorial windows in each game screen. They replicate many of the first steps described here. If you ignored them and are confused it would be a good idea to start a new game from scratch and follow all the tutorials before you start a station for good.

msgid "guide_first_station_basics"
The very first steps of any new station are building your initial rooms. Many of the objects your staff will use in their daily life and work need a proper shelter, so it is important to first learn what makes a room in Galactology.

A room is well defined when its entire ground is covered in floor tiles, and its entire perimeter is composed of wall segments and/or doors.

You make use of two tools for building rooms: the Floor Tool and the Walls Tool.

The Floor Tool allows you to draw a floorplan either tile by tile or by dragging the mouse left button to draw a rectangle of tiles. Select the floor and room style you want from the listing, and if desired, a highlight color in the top bar. When drawing on the map you can also press Shift to toggle the eraser mode, or Alt plus clicking on an existing floor tile to copy its style and color. You can mix and match all kinds of floor tiles.

The Wall Tool allows you to draw a wall blueprint either tile by tile or by dragging the mouse left button to draw an axis aligned line of tiles. Select the wall kind. Shift for eraser, and Alt for copying also works with the Wall Tool. And you can also mix any kind of wall.

Both tools produce a blueprint. This blueprint serves a workplace indicator for your officers and it is not functional as a part of a room.

The build mode visualization is active while a build tool is selected. In this mode a grid is displayed over the map, and the game will also overlay a green color over areas detected to be a properly formed room. A noise and aesthetical value will be assigned to each room depending on its contents and floor tile choices.

An empty but well formed room is only the start. Next you will need to build some objects and that is the job of the Object Tool.

The Object Tool allows you to place an object blueprint. Select an object category, then select an object from the list. Shift and Alt perform the same functions as in the other building tools.

Placing a blueprint will create a construction job most of the time, even if some conditions are not meet for a valid construction. Clicking on the blueprint will reveal any errors and why a construction job is stopped, if that is the case.


msgid "guide_first_station_rations_title"
        Setting up rations

msgid "guide_first_station_rations"

Let's take a look at how to produce rations, as an example on how production works.

One of the main tasks for your station is manufacturing products. You extract resources from planets and process them in your station into products. Those products can then be consumed by your officers, sold to visitors, or sold to planets.

Basic Rations is the first food product you can make. It will satisfy the Hunger vital for your officers. Producing Basic Rations requires Fruits, of which you have a starter stack when creating a new game.

To produce one or more Basic Rations you will need to build a Basic Kitchen. Once it is built, click it with the Info Tool. In the options panel you will be able to add a new production order by selecting which recipe you want to produce and which amount.

A factory object like the Basic Kitchen will create tasks for your officers when it detects all the required ingredients for its current production order are in stock somewhere in the station. Then, if one of your officers has the right job enabled (and by default all redshirts have all jobs enabled), they will first load the factory object with the required ingredients and then start producing the work order, one product unit at a time.

It is possilbe to automate the creation of production orders. First set one or more factory objects to global mode with the Info Tool. Then, in the Inventory Window, select the product you want to automate, and input a desired minimal stock amount. The game will try to keep that stock amount by issuing production orders to the factories set to global production.

It is not enough to produce rations, you also need to provide a place for your officers to consume them. Build one or more Canteen Tables so your officers can sit down to enjoy a meal and a drink. It is also a good idea to build food dispensers nearby, like the Canteen food and drink objects.

msgid "guide_first_station_landing_title"
    Exploration and extraction

msgid "guide_first_station_landing"

The station needs a steady supply of resources to keep production going. No resources grow in your home planet, so you have to look for them in other planets. Fortunately there is an entire galaxy around you, with many star systems and planets to explore.

The galaxy screen has two zoom levels. The default zoom level shows an overview of the entire galaxy, with your home system always in the center of the screen. You can zoom into discovered star systems by clicking on their star.

In the system view you can see its planets orbiting the star. If any of your ships is in this system they will be parked next to a planet. Other ships will be displayed in a circle around the system, so you can always interact with your fleet from any system.

To issue manual travel orders to a ship, drag and drop its icon on top of a planet. This will issue a travel order and the ship will leave your station or its current parked planet and travel to its new destination.

Once a ship is parked over a planet it becomes possible to explore it. Click on a planet to open its info window, then click the Explore button.

When exploring a planet your ship crew descends on to its surface and is able to move around, fight and build objects. This is important because in order to be able to extract resources, you need to build a resource extractor next to resource nodes. Resource nodes are areas on the surface of the planet with a disguishing aspect. Click on them to discover which resource they store, then build a extractor next to them, making sure you cover the entire area. Building more extractors over a given area will not make extraction go any faster.

It is also a good idea to build Storage objects on planets to increase the storage capacity. Your ships may take a long time to visit back, so it is easy to exceed the small storage capacity of an extractor object.


msgid "guide_first_station_autopilot_title"
        Autopilot

msgid "guide_first_station_autopilot"

Delivering extracted resources with manual travel orders would be very tedius. You can make use of the ship autopilot feature to automate the delivery of extracted resources to your station.

To open the autopilot orders window, go to the galaxy screen and click on a ship icon. This window displays a listing of autopilot orders. Each order is a stop the ship will make when you enable the autopilot, using the Start Autopilot button.

To add orders to the autopilot click the first button in the window toolbar, Add Order. This will display a listing of all the planets you have explored and built an extractor. Select a planet to add a new autopilot order. You can add as many orders as you want to any ship, but keep in mind its cargo hold capacity and its speed. Too many orders will make for a long, slow route which can be inefficient with early model ships.

Autopiloted ships automatically head back home when their cargo hold is full, or when its crew average morale falls below 25%. Once it has unloaded its cargo and its crew has rested it will resume its travels from the same point.

Ship crews take their needs very seriously when they are resting in the station, and will often priorize sleeping or eating before any kind of work task. Keep it in mind!


msgid "guide_first_station_credits_title"
msgstr "Making money"

msgid "guide_first_station_credits"

Your initial cash will run out sooner or later. While it is not an urgent need at the very start, making money should be one of your priorities in the early game. Many actions have a price to be paid in credits, the currency of the galaxy.

The most straightforward way of making money is to sell products you make in your station to other planets. This is accomplished in the Sell tab of in the Civs screen. Different civs like different products. Select a product you are stocking in your station, then a planet that has a demand for it. If you have available stock and a free ship you can send a delivery right away and get paid once the ship arrives.

Goals always have a cash reward, and they hit on many different areas of the game. Completing goals will both net you some income and guide your station development.

A hands on approach to riches is plain old plundering. When you visit an hostile planet and defeat enemies they will sometimes drop items. These items can be resources, equipment or some cash.

Once you are confident in your production and station facilities it could be a good idea to build some visitor docks so tourists can land in your station. They will come flush with cash. The more their civ likes you, the larger their wallets.

msgid "guide_officers_intro_title"
    Officers

msgid "guide_officers_intro"
Your officer staff is your most valuable asset. They will build, fight and work under your orders. But you must also provide for them by making sure their needs and demands are met. Expect a mutiny if you don't!

You can recruit new officers in the Staff screen, selecting Recruit in the left column. Every officer you recruit has a contract price, and it goes up the bigger your staff is. There is no limit to the amount of officers you can have, only the capacity of your station and production to keep them happy and busy.

    Equipment

msgid "guide_officers_items"

Equipping armor and weapons is the main way you can make your officers more powerful and resilient in combat. Wearable items are unique items that you can find in planet exploration loot, from dead enemies, and you can produce in your item factories.

They can be equipped in different slots like the chest or the feet. When your officers progress into a higher spec new slots become available to equip new items. Items are one time use only. Once equipped they cannot be droped, only overwritten by another item.

Items can enhance two properties of your officers. Hit points determine how much damage they can take from attacks. Power boosts their active item in whatever action they take. The total sum of these values is taken from all the equipped items for a given officer. Items also have a level number and optionally can also have a rarity qualifier. The level number of an item is a good indidcator of its power against same level enemies, so keep it in mind when exploring a planet.

Active items are used by your officers in combat. They have four possible actions: damage, healing, control and shielding. Damage items are used for attacking enemies. Healing items heal hitpoints on friendly units. Control items can stop enemies from attacking in various ways. Shielding items create a temporary shield around friendly units that absorbs damage from enemies. Officer AI is capable of controlling and using any kind of item by itself, but so are enemies.

msgid "guide_combat_title"
msgstr "Combat"

msgid "guide_combat"

Combat in Galactology is a mostly automated afair, with some variable level of player input. Your officers will be aware of their role depending on which kind of active item they are equipped with. Healers will seek friendly units to heal, shielders will await for damage to start affecting their friends, damage dealers will seek and pursue enemies, etc.

The main player input is meant to be general position orders. Select a group of officers with the Info Tool and then dragging the left mouse button. Or use the Info Tool plus shift click to add them to the selection one by one. Once you have an officer or a group selected you can issue movement orders by right clicking anywhere in the map. A Teleport action is also available to quickly transport your crew in and out of danger, with a cooldown.

You can save the current officer selection by pressing Ctrl then a numeric key from 1 to 6. After you do so, pressing 1 to 6 will automatically select the saved group. When you land on a planet a group is always created and bound to 1.

You also have the capability of issuing manual target orders. There is a target action for every kind of active item in the game (damage, healing, shielding and control). You can issue blanket orders in any heterogenous group and they will be issued only the the appropiate officers. Use these orders when you want more tactical control over combat. For example to focus attacks on enemy healers. Manual target orders are also required when you desire to attack neutral units. By default neither the officer AI nor the normal manual target action will work with neutral units; you must issue a manual target action while pressing shift for neutral units to be targetted.

Addionally, for planet exploration, one or more ship skills may be available. Ship skills are powerful but have a long cooldown. They can require your direct input to select a target area.
